In this branch was added:
- in the 1x1 widget, code was added to configure this widget for either 1 repo or ALL repos in the project
  - test loading the config, both in the config screen and the widget itself
  - write the loop to go over ALL repos in the org (might be already be available in another branch)


Do check the versions of the widget before pushing!
