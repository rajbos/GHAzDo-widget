In this branch was added:
- in the 1x1 widget, code was added to configure this widget for either 1 repo or ALL repos in the project
  - test loading the config, both in the config screen and the widget itself
  - write the loop to go over ALL repos in the org (might be already be available in another branch)


Do check the versions of the widget before pushing!


WIP:
 Load all alerts in the hub and show them.
 Currently the continue after the project calls does not go into loading the alerts,
 for org xpirit, seems to work in raj-bos
