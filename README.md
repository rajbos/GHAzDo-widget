Extension for Azure DevOps that shows the number of open security alerts for the configured repository. Please install it and let me know what you think! Create an issue for feedback or feature requests. 

Example:

# Things that I can think of to add:

- Think of more use cases:
  - show the total number of alerts for the project
  - show only a single number instead of all three (or add a checkbox for each alert type so users can mix and match)
- Add chart with the number of alerts over time (1 line for active and maybe a line for closed?)
